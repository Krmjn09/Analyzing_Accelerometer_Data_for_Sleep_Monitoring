💤 Sleepy Science: Detecting Zzzs with Accelerometer Data 🛌✨
Welcome to Sleepy Science, where data meets dreams! This project is all about unraveling the mysteries of sleep using wrist-worn accelerometer data. Whether you’re a sleep enthusiast, a data science geek, or just someone who loves their beauty rest, this project has something for you!

🚀 Project Overview
Imagine a world where we can detect when you drift off to sleep and when you wake up, just from the tiny movements of your wrist. Sounds dreamy, right? This project aims to do just that! Using accelerometer data, we’ve developed a machine learning model to accurately predict sleep onset and wake events.

Why is this important?
Sleep is crucial for everyone, especially for kids. By understanding sleep patterns better, we can:

🌙 Conduct large-scale sleep studies.
🧠 Improve mood and behavior interventions for children.
📈 Provide personalized sleep insights.
📚 The Dataset
We worked with a dataset packed with over 500 multi-day recordings of accelerometer data. Here’s what’s inside:

Training Data: Continuous data paired with sleep onset and wake events.
Test Data: Continuous accelerometer recordings waiting for our model's magic!
Key features:

anglez: The arm's angle relative to the vertical axis.
enmo: Movement intensity.
awake: Whether you're dreaming (0) or awake (1).
🧠 The Methodology
Our solution was carefully crafted like a bedtime story:

Feature Exploration: Analyzed anglez, enmo, and their patterns.
Preprocessing: Cleaned, imputed, and scaled the data for bedtime perfection.
Model Building: Tested several models to find the one that sleeps (and predicts) the best.
Validation: Fine-tuned with grid search to avoid sleepless nights debugging.
Prediction: Prepared a submission to detect the zzzs like a pro!
📈 Key Insights
Sleep detection isn't just about staying still – it's about detecting meaningful patterns in movement.
Combining features like anglez and enmo unlocks the full potential of accelerometer data.
Our model's predictions can help researchers make the world a better place, one good night’s sleep at a time!
🔮 Future Dreams
We’re not done dreaming yet! Here’s where we want to take this project next:

🌟 Add more features to capture complex sleep patterns.
🕵️‍♂️ Expand to detect REM cycles and sleep quality.
🛠️ Build an app for real-time sleep tracking.
